# EEG Brain Signal Detection And Classification

This project focuses on detecting and classifying EEG brain signals using a 1-D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project utilizes the BCG Dataset and is implemented in Python, leveraging Google Colab and High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. The model developed in this project has achieved a training accuracy of 83.08% and a testing accuracy of 82.67%.

## Project Overview

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method used to record electrical activity of the brain. This project aims to classify these EEG signals to identify various mental states or conditions. The primary goal is to develop a highly accurate and efficient model that can be deployed in real-time applications on resource-constrained devices.

## Features

- **1-D CNN Classification**: A 1-D Convolutional Neural Network is used to classify the EEG signals. The model has achieved significant accuracy in both training and testing phases.
- **Integration with TinyML**: Ongoing work focuses on integrating TinyML techniques to deploy the trained CNN model onto low-power microcontrollers. This aims to enable real-time EEG brain signal detection and classification on devices such as wearable EEG headsets.

## Technologies Used

- **BCG Dataset**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for implementation.
- **Google Colab**: Used for developing and training the model.
- **HPC (High-Performance Computing)**: Utilized to accelerate the training process.

## Results

- **Training Accuracy**: 83.08%
- **Testing Accuracy**: 82.67%

## Future Work

- **TinyML Integration**: The next step is to integrate TinyML techniques to deploy the CNN model on low-power microcontrollers. This will enable real-time detection and classification of EEG brain signals on wearable devices.
